# SQLANDPOWERBI-COMBINED

 ‚Äì SQL-Based Data Processing & Power BI Dashboard Project

## üìù Project Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to work across **both MSSQL (Test Environment)** and **MySQL (Production Environment)** for complete data processing, transformation, and KPI generation. Using Power BI, I created dashboards to analyze demand, supply, and financial metrics, highlighting my skill in database handling, business logic replication, and report development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environments Used

* **Test Environment:** Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
* **Production Environment:** MySQL Workbench

## üîÑ Workflow Summary

1. **Step 1: Data Cleaning & Joins**

   * Imported data into the **Test Environment** using MSSQL.
   * Performed **LEFT JOINs** to clean and combine data from multiple tables.
   * Replicated similar joins and data processing in the **Production Environment** using MySQL.

2. **Step 2: Power BI Integration**

   * Loaded cleaned data from both environments into Power BI.
   * Created DAX measures and KPI cards for:

     * Average Demand
     * Average Availability
     * Supply Shortage
     * Profit & Loss metrics

3. **Step 3: Cross-Environment Validation**

   * Ensured the **same business logic** applied to both environments produced **matching outputs**.
   * Confirmed that results such as average demand, shortages, and profit metrics were consistent across MSSQL and MySQL environments.

## üìå Skills Gained

* Proficient in **writing optimized SQL queries** in both MSSQL and MySQL.
* Experienced in **data transformation**, **joins**, and **ETL logic** replication across platforms.
* Developed **dynamic KPIs and DAX functions** in Power BI.
* Validated real-world business metrics with consistency across two different databases.
